# Slabsprak

This project provides a translation from English alphabet characters to characters that can be constructed of two vertically placed stairs or slabs in Minecraft.

This writing system was devised by the Minecraft Youtuber EthosLab in his video [Minecraft - HermitCraft S9#10: Alien Insides](https://youtu.be/P2_AUcWo3Pk?t=354).
